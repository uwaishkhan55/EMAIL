Test Assignment -

Build an API in NodeJS using express to send emails using the Gmail REST API. Do not use the client libraries.

Your application should -

- Obtain a Gmail user's credentials using OAuth 2.0. The OAuth 2.0 process should be initiated by an API call to your server.
- Store the obtained credentials in a file
- Have an API endpoint to execute send email using the credentials previously stored
- Include appropriate comments in your code on how to use the APIs written by you.
- Upload the server code to your Github and share the repository link with us.

There is no need for a visual interface, only the server code is needed.

Our team will contact you after evaluating your assignment.

\*\*Make sure that there is no bug.

Wish you all the best,
Anand Vijay
